## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using javascript to read and manipulate data in DOM elements can be fun. I this challenge, not only the flex direction changes, the size for cards are different in different viewports. Even the middle card height is different in desktop view.
I also added tablet viewport and some smooth animation to the project.

### Continued development

Making more animation specially for chaning the flex direction can make the project more eye catching.
